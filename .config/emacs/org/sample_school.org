#+TITLE: Layout of School Documents
#+STARTUP: showeverything

* Before anything else ...
 * [[id:0c53d724-4a86-481b-a835-eb1167454797][refile]]
   
* Layout of school.org
 * /Notes: general org-files
 * /Notes/SEMESTER_YEAR: the semester which will contain all class folders
 * /Notes/SEM_YEAR/clASS: all files for a class (ex. books, images, videos,
   class org-files, etc.)

 * In each semester folder, create a school.org file just like this one. The
   refile file will still be here tho, so don't create a new one (or ill be
   verysad). SIKE!

 * Achdulally ðŸ¤“, The previous one is no longer *avaliable* for acutal use.
   Instead I use org-roam so no school.org is needed to link the other files and
   just node-find & bookmark files to make life easier and less messier.
   

 * Am I still confused on how to properly structure this? Yes, yes I am.
