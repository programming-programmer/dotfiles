#+FILETAGS: :refile:

 * Everything begins here. Try to keep this minimal (refiling will be your fav)
 * Workflow
   * Pick something off today's agenda
     * deadline for today (do this first - it's not late yet)
     * deadline in the past (it's already late)
     * a scheduled task for today (it's supposed to be done today)
     * deadline that is coming up soon
   * pick a PROG task
   * If you run out of items to work on look for a PROG task in the current context pick a task from the Tasks list of the current project.
 
 * *"I long to accomplish a great and noble task, but it is my chief duty to
   accomplish small tasks as if they were great and noble." - Helen*
 
   
* Tasks :tasks:
** DONE Add capture templates [4/4]
 * [X] Errand
 * [X] Movie / Show
 * [X] Make capture for TODO with current date
 * [X] org-roam: MLA paper
** TODO Add variables for .org files in config.org (refile, work, personal)
 * Make it so that you just have to edit the path files in the variables.el file
   instead of going through the configuration file. Good Luck :)
 * For later don't bother please
** TODO Strikethrough DONE tasks
 * Needs some modifications
