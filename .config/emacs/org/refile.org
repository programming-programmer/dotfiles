** Stuff I'm fed up with
 * In light of my addiction to configuration. I am keeping a list of stuf I'm *fed up* with. After a _month_ I will visit this and deal with it at once
 * *Only when I have the time!*
 * Apply ThePrimagen's config logic
   * Only change something when it is so very annoying. Each month go through a
     compiled list and fix all in one weekend or free time. Unless it is
     *stopping* your workflow _do not_ waste time fixing. Have a great day :)
