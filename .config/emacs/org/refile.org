 * Workflow
   * Pick something off today's agenda
     * deadline for today (do this first - it's not late yet)
     * deadline in the past (it's already late)
     * a scheduled task for today (it's supposed to be done today)
     * deadline that is coming up soon
   * pick a PROG task
   * If you run out of items to work on look for a PROG task in the current context pick a task from the Tasks list of the current project.
 
 * *"I long to accomplish a great and noble task, but it is my chief duty to
   accomplish small tasks as if they were great and noble." - Helen*

** Apply ThePrimagen's config logic

   *stopping* your workflow _do not_ waste time fixing. Have a great day :)
